<b>Packet</b>

An encoded packet can be UTF-8 string or binary data. The packet encoding format:

<packet type id>[<data>]

example:

<color:grey>2probe</color>

The packet type id is an integer. The following are the accepted packet types.

<color:green>0 open</color>
Sent from the server when a new transport is opened (recheck)

<color:green>1 close</color>
Request the close of this transport but does not shutdown the connection itself.

<color:green>2 ping</color>
Sent by the client. Server should answer with a pong packet containing the same data.

example

<color:grey>client sends: 2probe</color>
<color:grey>server sends: 3probe</color>


<color:green>3 pong</color>
Sent by the server to respond to ping packets.

<color:green>4 message</color>
actual message, client and server should call their callbacks with the data.
example: 4HelloWorld

<color:green>5 upgrade</color>
Before engine.io switches a transport, it tests, if server and client can communicate over this transport.
If this test succeed, the client sends an upgrade packets which requests the server to flush its cache on the old transport and switch to the new transport.

<color:green>6 noop</color>
A noop packet. Used primarily to force a poll cycle when an incoming websocket connection is received.

example
client connects through new transport
client sends 2probe
server receives and sends 3probe
client receives and sends 5
server flushes and closes old transport and switches to new.


<b>Payload</b>

A payload is a series of encoded packets tied together.
The payload encoding format is as follows when only strings are sent and XHR2 is not supported:

<length1>:<packet1>[<length2>:<packet2>[...]]
length: length of the packet in characters
packet: actual packets as described above
